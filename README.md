# Predicting_spores
Using machine learning (in Python) to predict the occurrence of airborne fungal spores

### Background:
Spores released by the fungal plant pathogen * *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum* * are the primary infectious agents on a range of host plants. Diseases caused by * *S. sclerotiorum* * are economically important in a range of agricultural plants like canola, soybean, carrot, and lettuce. In dry bean crops, * *S. sclerotiorum* * is responsible for white mould disease. In this data set, I use a variety of ML algorithms to determine whether spores collected in dry bean can be predicted based on environmental cues.
